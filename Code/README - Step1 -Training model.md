Step1 - Training model

The first step on this project is to trained the model. To realise this, yon have to follow the instructions in this order :

1) The suite "Anaconda" must to be installed in your computer
 * For this application you don't need to install specific librairies in your virtual environment
2) Secondly, you have to enter "jupyter lab" on Anaconda prompt to open jupyter lab.
3) Before programming, you have to download the database called "FER 2013". This one is quickly downloadable from internet with this link :
https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013
4) When the database is downloaded you have to compile the program in the right order.
Be carreful to put the right link to call the database. So you have to modify this instruction :
emotion_data = pd.read_csv('/Users/romai/Documents/Ecole/Ingé - M1_auto/Q2/Système intelligent/fer2013.csv')

When the model is compiled and saved you can realise the step 2.
