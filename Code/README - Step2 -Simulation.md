Step 2 - Simulation

When the step 1 is Ok you can simulate the program in this order.

To run the application:
1) Open jupyter Lab
2) Compile the imports under point B "Testing model with camera"
3) compile point 1) "Loading the model with H5PY & the face detectcion model"
4) compile point 2) "Program performing emotion detection"
5) At this moment the interface opens
6) Put your head in front of the camera in a sufficiently illuminated room
7) Press the button "Start" to start the emotion test
8) Wait 10 seconds 
9) After this time the camera cuts out and you can analyse the results
10) Once the results are displayed you have 2 choices:
A) You can start a new test by clicking on "Start" again
B) You can close the application by clicking on "Close".
